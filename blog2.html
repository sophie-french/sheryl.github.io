            <h3>24/04/2014 09:59am</h3>
            <p>Last night we celebrated the launch of our new lightbox range with burgers, booze and play-doh. We had a fabulous night, with friends and family, new and old, dropping by to show their support to our business. To help make the night even more memorable, we invited an old high school buddy - Julia Flux - to come and play with her band, Blake Mills. The whole night was the definition of house party, and it was just an incredibly great night with lots of old and new friends laughing, eating, drinking and dancing (and playing with play-doh, obviously).</p>

            <p><a href="index.html">Here</a> are some awesome photos of the d reduce play-doh explosion wall, our guests code-named it "the wall of sweet" by the end of the night as they had smeared it with pretty greasy hands, drinking beers, and it became the background for a lot of the photos. Do you have any event coming up that might require some pretty, colourful things? Get in touch and let us arrange some dangling sweet lights or wall decorations. We're able to custom-make a lot of our products, so please ask if there is something a teeny bit different you want. Or, perhaps, you just want to buy a ready-made, wall-hang-up-and-plug-in thingy, then see our new lightbox range here.</p>

            <p>Keep an eye on our Facebook page, or sign up to our newslettr (below, on the right) to be kept in the loop with all the news, offers and events.</p>

            <p>We would like to say a special thank you to Dianne and Samantha from Little Star Events who provided delicious catering by Little Star Coffee and delicious Biff's Burgers from Biff's Burgers. They rocked with funky beats and kept everyone happy. Totally awesome.
